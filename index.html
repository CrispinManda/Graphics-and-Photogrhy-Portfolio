            "Capturing Life's Precious Moments"
            I'm Cris, a passionate photographer based in Nyeri. My love for photography began at a young age, and since then I've dedicated my life to capturing life's fleeting moments and preserving them in timeless images. I specialize in portrait, landscape and wedding and I'm always on the lookout for new and creative ways to tell visual stories. With 3 years of experience behind the lens, I've honed my skills to produce images that not only look good, but also evoke emotions and tell a story.
            
            ,<br> <b>"Bringing Your Vision to Life"</b> <br>
            I believe that every shot I take should be a reflection of the unique personality and spirit of my clients, and I work tirelessly to capture those special moments that they'll cherish for a lifetime. Whether it's a wedding, portrait session, or a simple walk in the park, I approach each shoot with the same level of excitement and professionalism. When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me codding websites, but photography is my true passion, and I'm always eager to take on new projects and challenges. If you're looking for a photographer who will go the extra mile to bring your vision to life, I'd love to hear from you!

            "Bringing Your Brand to Life"
           I have a passion for creating visually stunning designs that communicate a message, tell a story, and connect with audiences. With 3 years of experience in the field, I've honed my skills in branding, typography, illustration, and print design. I believe that every design should be a reflection of the client's brand and values, and I work tirelessly to ensure that each project meets their needs and exceeds their expectations.
            
           <br> <b> "Exploring New Horizons"</b> <br>
            In my free time, you can find me codding websites, but my true passion is graphic design. I'm always exploring new design trends and techniques to bring my clients the best possible results. Whether it's a logo, business card, or a full-fledged marketing campaign, I approach each project with the same level of creativity and attention to detail. If you're looking for a graphic designer who will work with you to bring your vision to life and explore new horizons, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
